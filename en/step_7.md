## What next?

In this project, you have:
+ Used `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} and `when I receive`{:class="block3events"} blocks so that the sprites can react to button presses
+ Used the `Pen`{:class="block3extensions"} extension blocks to `stamp`{:class="block3extensions"} sprites to create patterns
+ Added code to the **Stage**
