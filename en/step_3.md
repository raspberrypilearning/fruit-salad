## Choose more fruit
One type of fruit doesn't make a very interesting fruit salad. The Ingredient sprite has other fruit costumes to choose from.

--- task ---
Add code to the **Ingredients** sprite to switch to the next costume when you click on it. Go to `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and select the `next costume`{:class="block3looks"} block:

![Ingredients sprite icon](images/ingredientsSpriteIcon.png)

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
next costume
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now you can try out your project. Click on the **Ingredients** sprite until you see the fruit you want to add, then click on the bowl as many times as you like to add that fruit. You can't move a stamp once you have placed it so think carefully!

Choose a different fruit and stamp that as well.
