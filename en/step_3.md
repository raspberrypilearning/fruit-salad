## More fruit
One type of fruit doesn't make a very interesting fruit salad. The Ingredient sprite has other fruit costumes to choose from.

--- task ---
Add code to the **Ingredients** sprite to switch to the next costume when you click on it. 

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
next costume
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Now you can try out your project. Click on the Ingredient sprite until you see the fruit you want to add, then click on the plate as many times as you like to add that fruit. Then choose a different fruit and stamp that. 

You can't move a sprite once you have placed it so think carefully!
