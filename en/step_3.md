## Choose other fruit
To make your fruit salad more interesting, you might want to add other types of fruit. The **Ingredients** sprite has other fruit costumes to choose from.

--- task ---
In the **Ingredients** sprite, create a new script beginning with `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}. Go to the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks menu and select the `next costume`{:class="block3looks"} block to switch to the next costume:

![Ingredients sprite icon](images/ingredientsSpriteIcon.png)

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
next costume
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now, try out your project. Click on the **Ingredients** sprite until you see the fruit that you want to add, then click on the bowl as many times as you would like to add that fruit. You cannot move a stamp once you have placed it, so think carefully!

Next, choose a different fruit, and stamp that fruit too.
