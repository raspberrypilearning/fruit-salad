Add a `+` symbol to your button. To do this, press the <kbd>+</kbd> key on your keyboard.

Use the blue handles around the button to alter the size of the `+` symbol. Make sure that the `+` symbol fits within the button and can be seen clearly.

Now, you need to add some code to the **Grow** sprite.

--- task ---
Switch back to the **Grow** sprite's **Code** tab and add the following code to `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} a `grow` message `when the sprite is clicked`{:class="block3events"}:

![Grow button sprite icon](images/growButtonSpriteIcon.png)

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
broadcast [grow v]
```
--- /task ---

Now, you need to add some code to the **Ingredients** sprite so that it can receive the message to grow from the **Grow** sprite.

--- task ---

Select the **Ingredients** sprite and add the following code to enable it to grow:

![Ingredients sprite icon](images/ingredientsSpriteIcon.png)

```blocks3
when I receive [grow v]
change size by (5)
```
--- /task ---

Set the **Ingredients** sprite back to the original size each time you choose a new fruit costume. 

--- task ---

The **Ingredients** sprite is set to a starting size of `25`%. Find your existing `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} script and add a `set size to`{:class="block3looks"} block with the value `25`% to reset the size each time the costume changes:

![Ingredients sprite icon](images/ingredientsSpriteIcon.png)

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
+ set size to (25) %
next costume
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Run your program. Make sure that you can grow your pieces of fruit before you stamp them and check that they return to the original size each time you choose a new fruit costume.
