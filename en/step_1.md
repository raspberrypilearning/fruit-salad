## Introduction
In this project you'll create an app for family and friends to design their own fruit salad. Preparing food and creating art are great ways to relax - the Fruit salad app lets you make food art! 


### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Click on the plate to create stamps (copies) of the fruit you see in the top left.  
+ Click on the fruit to choose a different fruit. 
+ Click on the size or rotation buttons to alter the fruit before stamping it. 
+ You can't move or change the stamps after you add them so think carefully before laying out your fruit salad! 
+ Click the green flag to clear the plate and start again.
