## Introduction
In this project, you will create an app for family and friends to design their own fruit salad. Preparing food and creating art are great ways to relax â€” the Fruit salad app lets you make food art! 


### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Click on the bowl to create stamps (copies) of the fruit that you see in the top left-hand corner.  
+ Click on the fruit to choose a different fruit. 
+ Click on the size or rotation buttons to alter the fruit before you stamp it. 
+ Think carefully before you lay out your fruit salad, because you can't move or change the stamps after you have added them! 
+ Click on the green flag to clear the bowl and start again.
