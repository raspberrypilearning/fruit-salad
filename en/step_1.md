## Introduction
In this project you'll create an app that you can use to design your own fruit salad. Preparing food and creating art are great ways to relax, the Fruit salad maker lets you make food art! 


### What you will make

Click on the plate to create stamps of the fruit you see in the top left.  Click on the fruit to choose a different fruit. Click on the buttons to change the size or rotation of the fruit before stamping it. You can't move or change stamps after you add them so think carefully! Click the green flag to clear the plate and start again.
