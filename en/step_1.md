## Introduction
In this project you'll create an app for family and friends to design their own fruit salad. Preparing food and creating art are great ways to relax - the Fruit salad app lets you make food art! 


### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Click on the plate to create stamps (copies) of the fruit you see in the top left.  
Click on the fruit to choose a different fruit. 
Click on the size or rotation buttons to alter the fruit before stamping it. 
You can't move or change the stamps after you add them so think carefully before laying out your fruit salad! 
Click the green flag to clear the plate and start again.
